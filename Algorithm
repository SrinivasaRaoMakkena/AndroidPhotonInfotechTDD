 Finding it from right side(from R to L). Take the right 2 columns from matrix.

8 6
7 4
9 5
2 6
6 4
If now we are on the cell with value 8, the next step can be 6/4/4. Of course we choose 4 because we want a smaller cost. 
If now we are on the cell with value 7, the next step can be 6/4/5, we will choose 4. 
So the 2 columns can be merged into single column as below

12   //8+4
11   //7+4
13   //9+4
6    //2+4
10   //6+4
Now repeat the last two columns:

2  12
2  11
9  13
3  6
8  10
Finally the matrix will be merged into one column, the smallest value in the column has the lowest cost.
